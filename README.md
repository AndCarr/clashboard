In order to run `xml_paths.py` or `test_xml_paths.py`, the user must have the `AllPublicXML` directory located in the same directory that the `clashboard` repo was cloned into. This directory contains all study record information. It can be obtained through the zip file located [here](https://clinicaltrials.gov/AllPublicXML.zip). **NOTE**: The file will begin downloading upon opening the link. This file is very large and is updated frequently. In order to obtain the most recent information, the user will have to re-download the information when an update is required.
